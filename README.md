The concept/theme for this project is meant to represent the idea that not all search engines and the websites they provide are safe. The story I'm trying to portray is about a student researching for their assignment, and while clicking on different websites, the student comes across a website that is not safe and ends up with a virus.

I took inspiration from both Google and Tor to create the design of the search page - to make it look trustworthy enough that the student uses it regularly to the point they made an account and even customised the background to make it more personal. Thus, indicating that the student belives the browser to be safe, when in reality it is not. The second page is meant to look like a list of subjects that the student will search for their assignment. However, in the middle of studying the student who trusted the search engine results clicks on an unsafe website, and they are now at risk of getting a virus.
