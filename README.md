The concept/theme for this project is meant to represent the idea that not all search engines and the websites they provide are safe. The story I'm trying to portray is about a student researching for their assignment, and while clicking on different websites, the student comes across a website that is not safe and ends up with a virus.

I took inspiration from both Google and Tor to create the design of the search page - to make it look trustworthy enough that the student uses it regularly to the point they made an account and even customised the background to make it more personal. Thus, indicating that the student belives the browser to be safe, when in reality it is not. The second page is meant to look like a list of subjects that the student will search for their assignment. However, in the middle of studying the student who trusted the search engine results clicks on an unsafe website, and they are now at risk of getting a virus. 

The button of page three flashing red is meant to be a sign/warning that something is wrong but it is ignored by the student.

Challenges:
- the array for the searches in page one was not working but all I had to do it get rid of 'let word = theText' and 'i = 0 and changes word = theText[i];
  i=i+1; into text(theText[searchPage], 85, 185);
 searchPage++;
- another issue I had was with making the searches clickable in page two, to solve this I make a mousePressed function before page two instead of inside it.
- if I had more time I would have made the warning page cleaner and have better effects

The background (DREAMS.png), the profile.jpg, the logo (moons-clouds.png) and edit icon (edit.jpg) I created on Canva, the book on page two was drawn by myself, then taken a picture of and uploaded.
